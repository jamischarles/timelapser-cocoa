- Screenshot gallery with thumbnails
- Large preview pane
- Project history view

### Technical Architecture

#### Native macOS Implementation
**Core Technologies:**
- **Cocoa/AppKit**: Primary application framework for native macOS UI
- **Core Graphics**: High-performance screenshot capture using CGWindowListCreateImage
- **Core Image**: Efficient image processing and thumbnail generation
- **AVFoundation**: Video generation from screenshot sequences
- **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)**: Concurrent operations and background processing
- **Swift/Objective-C**: Primary development languages for optimal performance

#### Backend (Native macOS)
- **Screenshot capture**: Core Graphics CGWindowListCreateImage for ultra-fast screen capture
- **Image processing**: Core Image CIFilter for hardware-accelerated thumbnail generation
- **File I/O**: NSFileManager with async operations using GCD
- **State management**: Thread-safe property wrappers and actors (Swift 5.5+)
- **Video generation**: AVAssetWriter for direct MP4/MOV creation (optional FFmpeg integration)

#### Frontend (Native macOS)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI for modern, declarative interface OR AppKit for maximum performance control
- **State management**: Combine framework for reactive programming
- **Image loading**: NSImage with efficient caching and lazy loading
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time FPS and decode time tracking using CADisplayLink
- **UI components**: Native macOS controls with custom performance-optimized views

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Leverage Metal Performance Shaders for image processing
- **Memory Management**: ARC with careful attention to retain cycles and memory peaks
- **Background Processing**: All I/O operations on background queues
- **Efficient Rendering**: Core Animation and layer-backed views for smooth UI
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent NSCache usage for thumbnails and metadata

### Performance Requirements

#### Screenshot Capture
- Target capture time: <500ms per screenshot (improved from 1 second)
- File save time: <100ms per screenshot (improved from 200ms)
- Thumbnail generation: <50ms per thumbnail (improved from 100ms)

#### Memory Usage
- Thumbnail cache: Intelligent loading/unloading with NSCache
- Full image cache: Limited to currently viewed images
- Maximum memory usage: <300MB for 100 screenshots (improved from 500MB)

#### File System
- Disk space efficiency: Thumbnails reduce gallery loading by 500x
- File organization: Structured directory hierarchy
- Concurrent I/O: Non-blocking file operations using GCD

#### Video Generation
- **Native AVFoundation**: Primary method for best performance and integration
- **FFmpeg (Optional)**: Available for advanced codec support if needed
- **Hardware Encoding**: Utilize VideoToolbox for H.264/HEVC acceleration
- **Streaming Generation**: Process videos without loading all images into memory

### Quality Assurance

#### Testing Requirements
- Functional testing for all capture scenarios
- Performance testing with extended capture sessions
- UI responsiveness testing during heavy operations
- File system integrity testing
- macOS version compatibility testing (macOS 12+ target)
- Memory leak detection using Instruments

#### Success Metrics
- Screenshot capture reliability: >99.9%
- UI responsiveness: No blocking operations >50ms (improved from 100ms)
- File system performance: No I/O bottlenecks
- User experience: Smooth gallery navigation at 60fps
- Memory efficiency: <200MB baseline usage (improved target)

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Quality
